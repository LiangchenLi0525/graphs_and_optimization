# graphs_and_optimization
Includes a basic implementation of a graph class and selected network optimization algorithm.

## Introduction
When dealing with network optimization poblem, a handful intuitive and interesting algorithms exist already. For this repo, the goal is to implement selected algorithms. Since most algorithm runs on a graph, I will also provide a simple implementation of the graph class ready to use with neccesary basic functionalities. The project will be realized in both Python and Java files.
