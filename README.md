# graphs_and_optimization
Includes a basic implementation of a graph class and selected network optimization algorithm.

## Introduction
When dealing with network optimization poblem, a handful intuitive and interesting algorithms exist already. For this repo, the goal is to implement selected algorithms. Since most algorithm runs on a graph, I will also provide a simple implementation of the graph class ready to use with neccesary basic functionalities. The project will be realized in Java and Python(along with a identical .ipynb file).

## Graph Class Implementation
This class helps create graph objects. Only support directed unweighted graph with limited arc capacity

## Edmonds-Karp MaxFlow Algorithm
This algorithm uses BFS to find the shortest paths in a unweighted directed graph with limited arc capacity.
All implementations theoratically use Edmonds and Karp's approach to find the maximum flow of the capacity.
